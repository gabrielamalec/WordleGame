# Wordle Game
The aim of the game is to guess the 5-letter word. There are 6 rounds to do it. The user types the word and clicks enter or the 'Check!' button at the bottom of the program.
After the user enters a word, a validation is performed to see if all the fields have been filled in, if only the letters have been used, and finally if the letters typed form a real word.
When the typed word is a true word, then a letter check is performed.
• If the letter is in the correct place, the field in which it is located turns green.
• If the letter is in the word, but not entered in the correct place, the field turns orange.
• If the typed letter is not in the word at all, the field is gray.
